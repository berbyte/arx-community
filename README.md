    AI is already writing your code. You just don't see how.<br />

    ARX captures the prompts, decisions, tool usage, and workflows behind every AI-assisted session —<br />

## The problem

AI is writing more of your code every day. But the moment the session ends, the process disappears.

You see the diff. You don't see why the model made the choices it did, which prompts sent it in the wrong direction, where it spun its wheels retrying the same failing tool call, or how many tokens you burned on context it already had.

Git records what changed. Nothing records how it got there until now.

ARX hooks into your AI tool's session context and captures everything: every prompt, every tool call, every decision, every token. When the session ends, it turns that into structured reports you can act on.

**Works with:** Claude Code · OpenAI Codex · Cursor · GitHub Copilot

## Demo

[![ARX Demo](/docs/assets/demo-splash.png?c)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sDccFkLom4)

---

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get-arx.ber.run/install | bash
```

Installs the `arx` binary to `~/.local/bin` (or the first writable directory on your `PATH`). Available on **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**.

**The installer auto-detects your tools.** It checks for Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex and automatically configures hook integrations for each one it finds. No manual config required.

Then use your AI tools as normal. When you're done:

```bash
arx timeline
```

That's it. ARX never blocks or modifies your sessions. If a hook fails for any reason, it fails silently and logs in the background.

To remove ARX and all its hooks cleanly:

```bash
arx uninstall
```

## Features

- **Scorecard** a session quality report: tool success rate, prompt clarity, token waste, and actionable improvement suggestions
- **Timeline** a full chronological audit log of every tool call, token cost, and agent decision
- **Instruction compliance** tracks whether agents follow `AGENTS.md` instructions turn-by-turn, giving you a measurable signal where you'd otherwise have none

---

## Scorecard: Session quality report

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/scorecard.svg" alt="ARX Scorecard" width="600">
</div>

A high-level view of how a session went at a glance: execution (tool calls, failures, time split), prompt quality, cost efficiency, and concrete insights to improve the next session. Run it on any branch:

```bash
arx scorecard
```

**Full reference:** [docs/scorecard.md](docs/scorecard.md)

---

## Timeline: Full audit log

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/timeline.svg" alt="ARX Timeline" width="600">
</div>

A full chronological audit log of every tool call, permission request, and sub-agent — with token cost and context window usage per prompt block. Where the Scorecard tells you *what*, the Timeline tells you *why* and *how*.

```bash
arx timeline
```

**Full reference:** [docs/timeline.md](docs/timeline.md)

---

## Ping: AGENTS.md compliance check

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/ping.svg" alt="ARX Ping" width="600">
</div>

Instructions in `AGENTS.md` are not always followed, and there's no built-in way to know which sessions or turns skipped them. ARX tracks this with a lightweight ping mechanism the agent calls at the end of each turn, giving you a per-model compliance rate over time. Wired in automatically at install — nothing to add to your own `AGENTS.md`.

**Full reference:** [docs/ping.md](docs/ping.md)

---

## How it works

ARX hooks into your AI tool's session context — not your IDE, not your network traffic — and records the structured data that your tools already produce. After the session, it uses your local AI tools to evaluate and summarize what happened. Nothing leaves your machine except your email and GitHub username, submitted once at install time so we know who's in the beta.

**Full reference:** [docs/how-it-works.md](docs/how-it-works.md)

---

## Privacy

Your work stays on your machine. ARX **never** transmits your code, diffs, prompts, tokens, secrets, or API keys to us or anyone else — prompt analysis runs entirely through your local AI tools, which already hold that data.

**Full reference:** [docs/privacy.md](docs/privacy.md) · [docs/paranoid-setup.md](docs/paranoid-setup.md) for blocking all network access at the OS level.

## Early access

See how AI work actually happened. Join early teams using ARX to review prompts, decisions, tool usage, and execution risk before it turns into production debt.

**Limited design partner cohort — invites go out in batches.**
